On a warm Friday night, 11-year-old me was getting ready to sleep, excitement so high I couldn't hold my body still. I'd roll around in bed, one leg sticking out of the duvet trying to switch my brain off so morning would come sooner. I had just rented a nintendo 64 game, one out of the 3 or 4 games I'd get regularly on rotation. Back then it didn't matter if I had already played the same first 3 levels before having to return it to my local off brand blockbuster, only to get it again without my save (we all had hopes no one would override our saves before renting the game again right?).

6 am, that soft gaze of light sleep comes, between dream and reality. I would soon fall back asleep. For a split second, I'd remember I had something waiting for me downstairs. 

A rush of anxiety, the good kind. My body springs up in a single motion and I run towards the living room.

(took me years to learn anxiety was different than excitement)

Now, at 31, I have to force myself out of the covers, for another day of pointless staring at a screen typing characters on a colourful text editor that will then be used to drive revenue growth for some rich business man looking at another screen watching numbers go up. 5pm will come and I'll close my laptop and go find something to enjoy for myself. How can I rest after such an unproductive day? "I should have done more" - words that take shape as a small pit in my stomach.

Weekend rolls by, no work to be had but still no sign of anything worth getting out of bed for. Somewhere during these 20 years, I lost something. Call it child wonder, curiosity, will to live, purpose, whatever it is I don't have it anymore. I can picture the timeline of my life and these moments of rush dimming, getting more and more spread out through the days.

I always had trouble motivating myself to do anything. I learned to channel my fear of failure into overwhelming success. In school, the crippling fear of failing a class drove me to study frantically 2 days before a test, aiming for a passing grade. I'd almost always get As. 

I'll do everything correctly, with a sprinkle of anxiety of messing something up by mistake. I went back to therapy when time came for me to file for my taxes by myself for the first time. All I could think about was how I'd get deported for committing tax evasion by mistake. Nothing scares me more than not conforming.

But if _I_ wanted something, that same fear of failure wasn't there to save me. I'd be only be failing myself after all, and that's fine by me. As long as I'm not bothering anyone.

I stopped holding value in myself, slowly burning away my wants and dreams so I could fit my life into a mold that was made for me.
