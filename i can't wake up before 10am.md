On warm Friday night, 11-year-old me was getting ready to sleep, excitement so high I couldn't hold my body still. I'd roll around in bed, one leg sticking out of the duvet trying to switch my brain off so morning would come sooner. I had just rented a nintendo 64 game, one out of the 3 or 4 games I'd get regularly on rotation. Back then it didn't matter if I had already played the same first 3 levels before having to return it to the store, only to get it again without my save (I would pray that no other kid had overwritten it during the week, but of course that never happened). The high of living in that fantasy would still drive me through the week, impatiently waiting for the end of school week.

6 am, my brain would want to wake up again, leaving deep sleep so I could roll around bed again and enter my dreams again. But I'd remember I had something waiting for me downstairs, for a split second. My body rushed with anxiety, the good kind. Back then the only meaning I knew for the word was one of excitement in waiting.

Now, at 31, I have to force myself out of the covers, for another day of pointless staring at a screen typing characters on a colorful text editor that will then be used to drive revenue growth for some rich business man looking at another screen watching numbers go up. 5pm will come and I'll close my laptop and go find something to enjoy for myself, feeling guilty that my workday wasn't "productive enough".

Weekend rolls by, no work to be had but still no sign of anything worth getting out of bed for. Somewhere during these 20 years, I lost something. Call it child wonder, curiosity, will to live, purpose, whatever it is I don't have it anymore. I can picture the timeline of my life and how these moments of rush dimmed, getting more and more spread out through the days.
I always had trouble motivating myself to do anything. Any momentum I had was created externally. I learned to channel the fear of failure into overwhelming success. In school, the crippling fear of failing a class drove me to study frantically 2 days before a test, aiming for a passing grade. I'd almost always get As. 

But what for? Did I really want my numbers to go up? My parents didn't notice, they knew I could handle myself so they focused on my brothers. Why would I go to such lengths to be an overachiever for these external validators? While my stock prices went up for these mysterious investors, my internal value plummeted. If I wanted something, that same fear of failure wasn't there to save me because I'd be only be failing myself, and that's fine by me.

I stopped holding value in myself, slowly burning away my wants and dreams so I could fit my life into a mold that was made for me.
