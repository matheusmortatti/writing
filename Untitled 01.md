I'm hardly good with words. My mom always says I share my thoughts very eloquently and clearly, with deep care for the person listening but that comes out only after multiple minutes in silence while chatter around me goes wild. I listen very closely and build my thoughts upon observation before first letting out a single word. Even after that, I keep going back and rewriting that same thought as I listen.

It feels different when I think. A chaotic, unclear and unconfident minds lives inside of me. When it comes to understanding my feelings, worries, wants, _desires_, there's hardly a time where I have the tools to properly come to a conclusion. There's something very true about the rubber duck technique that shifts that very rapidly. I want words on paper to be my rubber duck for when I can't put shape into feelings.

I'm a victim of every emotional circumstance I find myself in. I adapt my feelings to the situation like a Chameleon trying to become small and unseen by those in front of me. When alone in my thoughts I yearn for a life I don't have. When confrontation comes - either from a romantic partner, people close to me or even strangers - I feel the weight of my words and hide behind niceties and reassurances that serve only others. And oh, _how I feel it_. Every bone in my body tells me I'm wrong for wanting, yearning to belong in another world I don't have access to.

Of course, we need to care for those around us, choose words wisely as to not make unwanted damage. Our lives are interconnected and every step we take has a potential to affect others. There's always a blast radius, no matter how big or small.

A few months back, I downsized the apps on my phone and limited my access to social media. Everyone and their mothers have heard about the digital minimalism movement, but we hardly talk about how challenging it can be when the constant entertainment, distraction and numbing hides you from challenging actions you know you need to take to push for a life worth living. The extra brain space leaving my phone behind has left exposed a load of scars I was hiding from myself and others close to me. It was like I was hiding a scratch on the wall paint by strategically placing furniture in front of it, only to realize that now that every inch of my walls were covered, making me forget the colour of the paint. 

I now have all this wall space full of chipped paint and the time to inspect everything, and I did. I questioned every part of my life from work, hobbies, relationships and how their state reflected who I wanted to be. I had nowhere else to look but within.

I don't mean to blame it all on technology and social media, of course. And that's not really the point. A lot of life was spent going through the motions, unaware of where I was heading and I don't have instagram to blame. It's just the tool I used to avoid questioning what I wanted for myself and let life grow around me while I was looking only up.
