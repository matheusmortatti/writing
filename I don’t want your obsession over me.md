Something about the ways people like me portray themselves. Silently moving through the world, observing every step around, collecting the most inner thoughts of others while keeping their processing within. Sharing most of our judgement to the voice inside ourselves.

It always repeats itself. We meet, hit it off on the surface. The few words I share thoughtfully make you feel safe, cared for. It's been so long since someone really listened to you, maintaining eye contact, really giving your words time to sink in. You open yourself more and more as I take time to process these inputs, running through all the different responses I could give until I find the one that seems to connect the most. You feel a deep connection with the person in front of you, as if he was the only person who ever understood you for who you are.

I am but a mirror, and you're falling for yourself. The image you see is the one you project onto me. I am still behind the thin sheet of glass in between us, but you cannot see. I won't let you. It protects my inner wilds, the carefully constructed universe I created for myself which only a select few explored. And as I slowly reach through the glass, it starts to crack revealing who's behind it. It's not who you thought it was.

You've seen your reflection for years. Some days you come closer and inspect the details, but the smallest sight of my real image makes you jump, like noticing a new ugly pimple on your face. I back away.

I don't want your obsession over me. Over yourself through me.

I know, I know. I created this ... out of fear to be misunderstood. And I was. I am. You've never seen the real me, no one really has. Not a single person came out alive from the jungle I created within and you'll be no different. But you feel left out none the less, now that the glass has finally shattered and I take the pieces to rebuild it in a rush.

I don't want your obsession over me. See through it, see me.

---
In shadows I tread, unseen yet ever-present,  
A silent observer in life's grand performance,  
Collecting whispers of innermost contemplation,  
Holding my judgment close within my heart's enclosure.  

Our encounter is fleeting, a dance on the surface,  
Words I share with care weave safety around you,  
Long lost art of listening, with eyes meeting eyes,  
You unravel your soul as I ponder each response.  

In me, you see a reflection, deep and profound,  
Believing this bond knows no parallel,  
Yet know, dear friend, it's merely the self you've found;  
A mirror that holds only what you choose to project.  

Behind the glass, veiled from your searching gaze,  
Lies my hidden wilds, my private universe—  
Exploration for but a chosen few through time and days,  
Yet now as I reach out, the façade begins to shatter.  

For years, you've gazed upon an image of yourself,  
Occasionally peering closer at its intricate form,  
But glimpse the truth behind, and recoil like a startled elf,  
Retreating from reality's unwelcome norm.  

I seek no obsession over myself through your eyes,  
Nor the self-reflection that clings to my guise.  

From fear of misinterpretation, this image was wrought—  
And misunderstood I have been, then and now.  
The real me remains hidden, a mystery unsought;  
For none have ventured deep within without consequence, somehow.  

Yet with shattered glass, you sense exclusion's sting,  
As I hastily mend the fragments in flight.  

I yearn not for your fixation on my being or its reflection,  
Look beyond the surface, see me truly—  
In all my complexity, with all that it entails.
