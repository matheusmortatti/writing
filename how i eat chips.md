hands cupped around a crackling balloon, fingers adjusting the grip to the crisp rattling as I close the cupboard. * _to-doom_ *. I drop onto the couch as if my legs forgot how to hold my body.

My fingers form a pinch between both sides of the bag and miscalculated force bursts it open. I immediately turn my head over to my cat. He peers over, confused, eyes wide sniping briefly trying to find where the sound came from but after 3 seconds, his tiny little head goes back between his paws. This head dance takes the focus away from the grease and salt scent that oozed from between my hands, but I catch its last hint before it flies away.

While I try to find the perfect chip, I can feel the shine I'll witness in my hands as I pull it out. No matter, I knew what I was getting into.

Mouth open, it touches my tongue before my lips and with a crack, my teeth are put to work. It breaks in sharp angles and scratches the roof of my mouth, the moisture slowly softening my senses but not before I know I'll feel the consequences tomorrow morning. Texture transforms from crisp into mush.

I swallow. The cycle repeats.

My tummy hurts now.
