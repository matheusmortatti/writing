I don't feel like myself anymore. Through constant trims and cuts done to me, I lost my sense of self and what made me who I am.

There's no joy brought from the things that made me whole. Photography, cooking, programming, 3D printing, playing the guitar. Nothing lights that spark in me anymore.

I have always been aggressively passive. I'd stand still when others around me were moving. The few times I left my own, tiny spot in life were when I got pushed by others and it brought me somewhere great, in theory. I work at a big, well paying company, have an amazing cat, a great apartment and all the things I wished for at some point. But is this the place I really wanted to be? Was it here that I was supposed to end up if I walked with my own legs?

This is not a story about how my parents pressured me into a life as an engineer. They encouraged me throughout with anything I wanted, but society (aka everyone around me) were all heading one way so I followed suit using my own internal pressure gauge. I played nice thinking if others were happy for me, I would end up happy too. I entered a long term relationship, got married and fled to a far away developed country only to find myself be the one underdeveloped.

Throughout my relationship, I found myself giving away my own space to make hers bigger. Now I find that space unused, but claimed tightly under her grasp as I suffocate myself in this tiny box. I'm loosing my air, not knowing how much it fled and how much I inhaled.

Anger always slipped away in my adult life. It feels undeserving, unlearned and shameful but it could be my friend if I let it take the weight off my shoulders. Rejecting it completely might be why I ended up here, not allowing it to wrap around my wants, needs and desires. Let it push that hidden passion out of it's cage.

I wonder if I'll ever let it.
